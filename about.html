            <h2>What's the deal with this guy, anyway?</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Dane. I was born and raised in Columbia, Missouri - home of the Tigers!
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a freshman at the University of Missouri - I'm majoring in Information Technology.
                Technology has been my passion since I was a young kid. I've always been interested in computers, how they work,
                and how they can be used. Taking apart, rebuilding, repairing, and learning about computers and electronics has been my hobby of choice for the past
                10 or more years.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's not to say I haven't had my fair share of detours in interests along the road. I collect a variety of interesting items, with many
                playing parts in various hobbies I've had over the years. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In a somewhat exhaustive list, I collect:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pens</li>
                <li>Bicycles</li>
                <li>Cameras</li>
                <li>Typewriters</li>
                <li>Oscilloscopes</li>
                <li>Radios</li>
                <li>Crystals</li>
                <li>Books</li>
                <li>Card Decks</li>
                <li>Board Games</li>
                <li>Watches</li>
                <li>Typewriters</li>
                <li>Ticket Stubs</li>
                <li>Vinyl Records</li>
                <li>Esoteric Camera Film</li>
                <li>Coins</li>
                <li>Slide Rules</li>
                <li>Enamel Pins</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                And after writing all of those out... I feel as though I might have a problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                But please, feel free to talk to me about any of them!
            </p>
