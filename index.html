            <p>
                Currently, this is my final project for INFOTC-1000 at the University of Missouri. 
                Once finals are complete, I will likely turn this into a website for my general use, with contact information and a blog.
                This specific version of the website will remain in this repository for now. The public version will be hosted elsewhere, or at minimum in another repository.
                
            </p>

                After completing the course, I was able to create a website that I can use to display the skills I have learned.
                I have learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have also learned how to use Git and GitHub to manage my code. And, (obviously), I have learned how to use GitHub Pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please explore the website to learn more about me and my projects.
